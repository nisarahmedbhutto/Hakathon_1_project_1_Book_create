# System Overview

Our platform represents a revolutionary approach to technical documentation and education in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to deliver comprehensive, accurate, and relevant content.

## Core Principles

The system operates under the following core principles derived from our project constitution:

- **Scientific Integrity**: All technical content is grounded in established scientific principles and validated against scientific evidence
- **Ethical Foundations**: Human safety, dignity, and well-being are paramount in all content
- **Human-Centered Design**: Systems are designed to augment, not replace human capabilities
- **Safety and Reliability**: Safety-by-design principles are emphasized throughout
- **Technical Excellence**: High standards in robotics are maintained across all content
- **Global and Interdisciplinary Perspective**: Diverse contributions and perspectives are acknowledged
- **Modularity and Clarity**: Content is structured modularly with independent lessons
- **Transparency and Responsibility**: Technology limitations are clearly stated

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **AI Content Generation**: Specialized agents that continuously scan research papers, documentation, and repositories
2. **Review and Validation**: Multi-stage review process with automated checks and human approval
3. **Content Delivery**: Docusaurus-based frontend that presents content in an accessible format

## Continuous Update Process

Content is continuously updated through the following process:

1. AI agents identify relevant research and developments
2. Content is generated following established templates and guidelines
3. Automated review checks for technical accuracy and ethical compliance
4. Human experts review and approve content
5. Updated content is published to the living book
6. Version control ensures all changes are tracked and reversible
